# University Assignment: Pizza Factory Game

## Why?
- This was made for a University assignment.
- This was worth 50% of the Programming unit.

## What?
- I had to design and implement in Processing (Java), a 2D "product assembly line" game, which involves adding Components to assemble a Product on a conveyor belt.
- Different types of Components were to be added to each of several moving Products.
- The mouse should be used to drag Components to the assembled product.
- The game concept I chose was a Pizza Factory: Pizza appears and moves right to the left across the bottom of the screen and must be completed before it reaches the left-hand edge.
- Topping items can be collected by dragging them to the pizza.

## How?
- Made with [Processing.org](https://processing.org)
- Made in Java 17
